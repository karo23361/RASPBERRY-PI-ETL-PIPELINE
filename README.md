# RASPBERRY-PI-ETL-PIPELINE

ðŸ“„ Project Description
PiLine is a simple data engineering project that shows how to move data from CSV files into a data warehouse using multiple tools and systems. The goal is to build a small but realistic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using:

- CSV files with fake business data (each 100k records)

- A MySQL database running on a Raspberry Pi

- A SQL Server database as the main data warehouse

- SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) for data transfer and transformation

ðŸ“¦ Data Sources
This project uses sample CSV files with randomly generated data. The datasets include:

- customers.csv â€“ customer records

- people.csv â€“ user profiles

-> organizations.csv â€“ company info

> leads.csv â€“ sales lead data

> products.csv â€“ product catalog

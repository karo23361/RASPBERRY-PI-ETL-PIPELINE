# RASPBERRY-PI-ETL-PIPELINE

ðŸ“„ Project Description
PiLine is a simple data engineering project that shows how to move data from CSV files into a data warehouse using multiple tools and systems. The goal is to build a small but realistic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using:

> CSV files with fake business data (up to 2 million records)

> A MySQL database running on a Raspberry Pi

> A SQL Server database as the main data warehouse

> SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) for data transfer and transformation

ðŸ“¦ Data Sources
This project uses sample CSV files with randomly generated data. The datasets include:

> customers.csv â€“ customer records

> people.csv â€“ user profiles

> organizations.csv â€“ company info

> leads.csv â€“ sales lead data

> products.csv â€“ product catalog
